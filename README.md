# Augmented Reality Mirror

The **Augmented Reality Mirror** is an AR game that lets you see how your muscles and bones move in real-time. <br>
This is a scientific outreach project that I completed during my time at the [Vanderbilt MASI](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/masi/) lab for the 2019 Vanderbilt Undergraduate Summer Research Program.

## Description

The **Augmented Reality Mirror** interfaces an [Astra Orbbec](https://shop.orbbec3d.com/Astra) camera with [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) to render anatomical models over a live video stream. <br>

## Getting Started

### Tools

* An [Astra Orbbec](https://shop.orbbec3d.com/Astra) camera
* [Orbbec SDK](https://www.orbbec.com/developers/orbbec-sdk/)
* Unity3d
* Blender

### Notes
This project aims to develop a demonstration platform for communicating the scientific results to a lay
audience (targeting K 12) while providing a framework to offer research experiences to young
(underrepresented) scientists and high school teachers. New interactive course modules will be
developed using this project. These modules will be targeted to a broad range of abilities from high
school math/science/programming classes to graduate-level seminars. The Augmented Reality Mirror is
an open-source rendering software to provide users with a virtual reality experience. With the provisions
of a projection display, a laptop with a multi-core GPU, and an Astra Orbbec camera, users can stand in front of the
mirror and representative anatomical images will overlay the body. The images implemented are
adapted to approximate the actual anatomy. The open-source software will have an application
programming interface (API) to allow users to develop additional content within the Augmented Reality
Mirror.
